Hi I'm a bot, the bunq-bot here to help you the best way I can.

My commands are:
/start `To start receiving automatic messages.`
/stop `To stop receiving automatic messages. This command should also be used before you want to remove me.`
/news `Shows the recent 5 blog posts from bunq.`
/help `Displays a help message.`

My source code can be found [here](https://github.com/OGKevin/ComBunqWebApp/tree/master/bunq_bot).
