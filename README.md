Community BunqWeb is going to be a web interface for bunqers using the [Bunq API](https://www.bunq.com/en/api).



Disclaimer: Bunq itself has nothing to do with this project



View the app live based on the latest release: <https://combunqweb.herokuapp.com/manager>

# Goals

  - Bunqer can see his/her transactions and can use filters/sorting

  - Bunqer can generate a bunq.me QR code

  - Beautiful Front-End work

  - Secure way to handle users API keys



# Current Features!

# Why Community ?

> Would be convenient to have a non-mobile version of bunq! Is there something on the roadmap? -[Tezzlicious][ForumLink]



> We kijken naar de mogelijkheden, maar hebben hier geen korte termijnplannen voor, aangezien we ons volledig op het ontwikkelen van de app focussen. -[Bunq][Answer]



### Contribute

All pull request are welcome, because this project is mixed with Front- and Back-end, there can be 2 ways to contribute to the project.



#### Front End



1. In the folder [templates](../master/templates/) you will find HTML documents. These templates are used to render the front end. In some of these files there might be wierd markings like:

    ```html

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{%static "Manager/CSS/index.css"%}"/>

    {%for x in data%}

        <tr>

		    <td>{{x.0}}</td>

		    <td>{{x.1}}</td>

		    <td>{{x.2}}</td>

	    </tr>

    {%endfor%}

    ```

    This is  back end stuff and you shouldn't worry too much about it for now.

- In the folder [static](../master/static/) you will find the CSS and JS documents used by the templates.

- Change the ```href=''``` and ```src=''``` attributes by duplicating it, commenting one of them out and change the other one to```/static/Manager...``` like you normally would. After you're done and ready to make a pull request uncomment the original line and remove the edited one.



For Front End packages we use [npm][npm] so make sure u install and use the dependencies in the [package.json](../master/package.json) file by running

```sh

$ npm install

```
U can also make use of placeholder texts :-)
##### Todo

- create a front page

- beautify the page too show graphs and additional transactions info etc





#### Back End

For this project we're going to use [Django][django] and [Heroku][heroku], make sure you have these 2 softwares installed.
Before you perform any of the following commands make sure your are in the root directory of the project.

1. run ```$ pip install -r requirements.txt``` to install the python packages used in this project. It might be a good idea to setup and use [virtualenv][virtualenv].

- setup local postgress database and change the database settings in [settings.py](../master/BunqWebApp/settings.py) file

- now we need to collect static files by running the following:

    ```sh

    $ ./manage.py npm install

    $ ./manage.py collectstatic

    ```

- to run a local development server:

    ```sh

    $ ./manage.py runserver

    ```

    Before you push your chages make sure it runs on heroku as well by using

    ```sh

    $ heroku local

    ```

    and see if heroku can handle the greatness what awaits.

    

##### Todo

- Create database models for storing user info
- ~~Create database models for storing catagories~~

- Hook it up to the Bunq API

- ~~Fix staticfiles issue #1~~
